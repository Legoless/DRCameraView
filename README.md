DRCameraView
============

DRCameraView is a UIView subclass to display camera preview and take pictures or video with a very simple API. The control is very customizable and allows for custom UI and multiple settings. It does not provide any photo selection collection views, it is just meant for taking pictures.

It includes fully custom camera interface which can be additionally customised by several properties.

Or setup your own camera interface with either a view from Storyboard or in code and use all camera functionalities.

Video functionality is currently not supported, but will be in future releases of the library.

DRCameraView is built on top of DesignKit and also serves as a sample project for it.
